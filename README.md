# ENNs

Entangled Neural Networks represents a neural architecture inspired by principles from quantum computing, specifically superposition, entanglement, and state interference. By incorporating multi-state neurons, adaptive entanglements, and probabilistic pathways, ENNs aim to provide an adaptable, highly efficient, and contextually aware neural network that competes with existing architectures in both interpretability and real-time adaptability.

### **Primary Goals of ENNs**

1. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: ENNs use entangled dependencies to create layers of context within the network, allowing for deeper interpretability.
2. **Efficiency in Complex Data Processing**: With adaptive multi-state neurons and probabilistic paths, ENNs manage computational resources effectively.
3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: By integrating hardware-optimized modules, ENNs can run efficiently on high-performance local machines and scale across data centers.

### **1. Core Architecture with Adaptive Multi-State Neurons**

- **Multi-State Neurons**: Neurons activate multiple states, scaling based on data complexity to simplify processing.
- **Contextual State Collapse**: Dynamically collapse states using entropy-based pruning to retain only relevant states.
- **Implementation**: Utilize tensor operations for state management and threshold-based activation for efficient scaling.

### **2. Conditional Entanglement with Selective Gating**

- **Attention Gating**: Activate entangled neurons based on contextual relevance, managing dependencies through thresholded activation.
- **Probabilistic Pathways**: Integrate conditionally activated paths, allowing controlled randomness.
- **Weight Sharing**: Share weights across entangled neurons with similar activation patterns, reducing redundancy.
- **Implementation**: Use matrix multiplication and attention mechanisms (e.g., scaled dot-product attention) to conditionally activate entangled pathways.

### **3. Real-Time State Refreshing and Event-Driven Processing**

- **Asynchronous Event Activation**: Neurons update based on new data or events, rather than batch cycles.
- **Selective Mini-Batch Processing**: Handle continuous data streams with low-latency updates to multi-state neurons.
- **Implementation**: Utilize asynchronous processing (e.g., async functions) to manage neuron activations based on event importance.

### **4. Short-Term Memory Mechanisms and State Decay**

- **Fast State Decay**: Neurons decay older data influence, retaining priority for recent input.
- **Adaptive Short-Term Buffer**: Store a limited activation history, preserving relevant short-term information.
- **Weight Scaling**: Dynamically prioritize recent connections, using temporal scaling based on recency.
- **Implementation**: Apply decay functions in neuron state management and use FIFO queues or sliding windows for short-term memory.

### **5. Advanced State Collapse with Interference-Based Attention**

- **Entropy and Interference-Based Pruning**: Prune states by entropy, amplifying compatible states while suppressing conflicts.
- **Auto-Encoder State Collapse**: Use auto-encoders to retain key features across states before final selection.
- **Implementation**: Employ auto-encoding for compact representation, applying interference principles to preserve relevant information.

### **6. Dynamic Sparsity Control and Resource Optimization**

- **Dynamic Sparsity Thresholds**: Adjust active states and neuron connections based on computational constraints.
- **Event-Triggered Sparse Backpropagation**: Trigger sparse backpropagation with significant input changes to avoid redundant updates.
- **Low-Power State Collapse**: Simplify neuron states under power constraints, focusing on highly activated states.
- **Implementation**: Use dynamic threshold functions to adjust sparsity, selectively deactivating low-priority neurons.

### **7. Context-Aware Training and Meta-Optimized Learning**

- **Context-Aware Weight Initialization**: Use modified Xavier or He initialization to reflect entanglement, accelerating convergence.
- **Meta-Optimized Learning Rate Scheduling**: Apply meta-learning to adapt learning rates based on neuron stability and entanglement.
- **Sparse Gradient Aggregation and Clipping**: Aggregate and clip sparse gradients to manage extreme values and improve stability.
- **Implementation**: Leverage meta-learning algorithms for dynamic learning schedules and use gradient clipping in feedback loops for stable training.
